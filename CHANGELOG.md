# Changelog

All notable changes to `scitex-scholar` are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **The citation graph's 503 now says what to do about it.** All four
  `/api/graph/*` routes answered `{"error": "CrossRef API not configured"}` —
  the right status with half an answer, leaving a first-time user with no next
  step (measured 2026-09-02 as a standalone first-run blocker). The body now
  also carries `detail` (the graph reads a crossref-local HTTP API; scholar
  never opens the corpus itself), `fix` (set `SCITEX_SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_API_URL`,
  or install `crossref-local` for its default endpoint, then restart) and
  `setting`. One shared payload, so the four routes cannot drift into four
  explanations; `graph_health` keeps its `status` field and every route keeps
  503.

### Fixed
- **The skills-quality gate had been skipping since 2026-05-01 and is now
  executed.** `tests/skills/test_skills_quality.py` passed `parents[1]` as the
  package root; that named the repository root while the file sat at
  `tests/`, and named `tests/` after it moved to `tests/skills/` (c978ba3).
  The scitex-dev helper answers an empty corpus with a lone `pytest.skip()`,
  and pytest exits 0 when everything skips, so the check reported success
  without grading anything for four months. The root is now found by walking
  up to `pyproject.toml`, and a new test FAILS (rather than skips) when the
  skill corpus cannot be found, so a future move goes red instead of quiet.

### Changed
- **The citation graph and the standalone GUI now read the crossref-local
  endpoint from `SCITEX_SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_API_URL`**, the variable the metadata
  engine, `config/default.yaml` and the documented env table already used for
  the same endpoint. Before, the GUI/citation-graph path read a second name
  (`SCITEX_SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_LOCAL_API_URL`), so setting the documented one
  configured the metadata engine and left the citation graph unconfigured.
  The env table's claim that the variable pointed at `api.crossref.org` was
  wrong and is corrected: the public CrossRef REST URL is fixed in code.
  `resolve_env` accepts several legacy spellings in precedence order.
- **The crossref-local endpoint setting is now `SCITEX_SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_API_URL`**
  (was the bare `CROSSREF_API_URL`). A host such as scitex-hub defines this
  setting in its own settings module, where an un-namespaced name is one
  collision away from meaning something else; the new spelling is also the
  env-var name hub already exports for the same endpoint, so host and leaf
  agree on one name. The standalone settings module defines only the new name.

### Deprecated
- **`SCITEX_SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_LOCAL_API_URL`** (and the older
  `CROSSREF_LOCAL_API_URL`), still read when `SCITEX_SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_API_URL`
  is unset, with one warning per process per name. Removed together with the
  other legacy env spellings (see `scholar-env-legacy-fallback-removal`).
- **The bare `CROSSREF_API_URL` Django setting.** Still read when the
  namespaced one is unset, with one warning per process naming both spellings,
  and removed in 1.12.0. Set both during the window if you must support both
  releases; the namespaced name wins when both are present.

### Added
- **`scitex_scholar._django.views` refuses to import when the app is not in
  the host's `INSTALLED_APPS`**, raising `ImproperlyConfigured` that names the
  entry to add (`scitex_scholar._django.apps.ScholarEditorConfig`). On
  2026-09-05 prod mounted the views without the app, Django's template loader
  could not see `scholar/scholar.html`, and every logged-in request answered
  500 while anonymous probes were redirected to login and saw nothing. The
  refusal fires where the host's urlconf and `manage.py check` import the
  module. It is silent when the app registry is not yet ready (an early
  importer is unknown, not misconfigured).

### Changed
- **`_server.py` imports `hosts_to_allow` from scitex-app (`>=0.11.0`)** instead of
  carrying its own copy. Scholar wrote the first implementation (#137); it was
  copied verbatim into scitex-app and became the fleet's single one, with a
  public name from 0.11.0. The private copy and its five behaviour tests are
  gone; what remains here is the wiring.

### Removed
- **The bare-Django fallback in `scitex-scholar gui serve`.** When scitex-app
  was unimportable the launcher printed a note and ran plain `runserver` with
  no workspace shell. With the ALLOWED_HOSTS derivation now living in scitex-app
  too, that fallback would also silently drop the `0.0.0.0` handling — a second,
  quieter way to break. scitex-app is a hard member of the `[server]` extra
  (settings.py already hard-imports scitex_ui by the same reasoning), so a
  missing install now fails at import, where the cause is legible.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-09-02

MINOR, not patch. This release removes public API (`CitationGraphBuilder(db_path=)`,
`library db migrate`), renames a CLI option (`--db-path` → `--api-url`) and two
`/api/health` fields, moves the Django ORM to PostgreSQL, and flips the
`DJANGO_DEBUG` default. None of that belongs in a patch. It follows this repo's
precedent of shipping breaking surface changes in minors (the Flask→Django GUI
went 1.7.x → 1.9.0); a strict reading would call it 2.0.0, and that reading was
considered and not taken.

### Security
- **`DJANGO_DEBUG` now defaults to `"false"`** (#137). It defaulted to `"true"`,
  which selected `ALLOWED_HOSTS="*"` on an app with no authentication for any
  `gui serve` that forgot the env var. Flipping the default alone would have
  reintroduced the 400 that #126 fixed for `--host 0.0.0.0` — a bind-all server
  receives real interface addresses in the Host header, and `0.0.0.0` never
  matches them — so `--host 0.0.0.0` now contributes this machine's hostname
  and every interface IPv4 (read from the interfaces via `SIOCGIFADDR`, not from
  name resolution, which resolved to the wrong address inside a container).
  Standalone `/static/` is served through the staticfiles finders regardless of
  `DEBUG`; `urls.py` (what hub mounts) is untouched. Verified live on three
  arms; the interface-enumeration test derives its expected address by an
  independent method so it is not the implementation checking itself.

### Added
- **`/api/health` reports `version`** (#132), so "is this deployment running
  what we shipped?" is answerable over HTTP. Scholar served no version anywhere
  before; scraping the page for one produced a false positive off a CDN URL
  (`highlight.js/11.9.0`). Caveat carried in the docstring: the value comes from
  `importlib.metadata`, which is frozen at install time, so it is trustworthy for
  a deployed wheel and not for an editable dev checkout.
- **Tests now guard the urlconf shape hub authenticates** (#129): every entry
  must be a flat `URLPattern`, because hub gates the leaf by wrapping each
  callback in `login_required`, and a nested `include()` would publish its
  routes unauthenticated. Includes a positive control that builds an
  `include()` and asserts the predicate rejects it.

### Fixed
- **The local test run tests THIS checkout** (#130). `pythonpath = ["src"]` in
  pytest config plus a session-start guard that compares the imported module
  PATH (never `__version__`) against the checkout and aborts (exit 3) on a
  mismatch. Before this, a bare `pytest` imported whatever wheel the ambient
  interpreter held — an older wheel went red and exposed it; an equal-or-newer
  one would have gone green against code the branch did not contain. CI never
  saw it and cannot: it installs the branch.
- **`scitex-ui>=0.19.0`** (#131): the shared shell hardcoded `<html lang="en">`,
  which is where a screen reader takes its pronunciation rules. Scholar does not
  call `shell_context()`, so it depends on the template-level default; verified
  on a real response from the published wheels. Two stale prose claims deleted
  in the same change — one of them a pinned "verified against scitex_ui 0.17.0"
  that had been quoted as a measurement while 0.18.0 was installed.

### Changed
- **Scholar's own state moved off local database files and onto the shared
  store (`scitex_dev.store`).** Fleet ruling, 2026-08-29: storage is the
  per-host PostgreSQL, reached through the shared primitive.
  - The **library index** (`library db build/lookup/list`) no longer writes
    `<library_root>/index.db`. Rows live in the `scholar_library_index` table,
    keyed by `(library_root, paper_id)` so one store can serve every library on
    the host. Papers that disappear from `MASTER/` are HIDDEN rather than
    deleted, and a later rebuild un-hides them.
  - The **JCR impact-factor table** moved to `scholar_impact_factor`. This also
    fixes the lookup outright: `DEFAULT_DB` resolved to a path OUTSIDE the
    repository after the monorepo split, so every impact-factor lookup had been
    failing silently. `build_database.py` now loads a JCR Excel export into the
    store and stamps each row with the JCR edition it came from, instead of
    re-deriving the year from a filename at read time.
  - The **Django ORM** points at `scitex-primary:55432/scitex`, overridable per
    field via `SCITEX_SCHOLAR_DB_*`.
- **The citation graph talks to crossref-local over HTTP only.** Scholar no
  longer opens crossref-local's data files itself; the package that owns that
  corpus is the one that reads it. `CitationGraphBuilder(db_path=...)` is gone
  — pass `api_url=`, or leave it unset and let the endpoint be resolved from
  `SCITEX_SCHOLAR_CROSSREF_LOCAL_API_URL`. The GUI's `--db-path` option is now
  `--api-url`, and `/api/health` reports `api_available` / `api_url` in place
  of `db_available` / `db_path`.

### Removed
- **`library db migrate`.** It managed a schema version inside an index file.
  The store owns schema declaration, so there is nothing left for it to do.
- **`citation_graph/database.py`** and the local-file citation-graph mode.
- **`cli/_library_index.py`** — an orphaned second implementation of the `db`
  subcommands whose `register_subparser` was never called from anywhere.
- **`sql-manager` and `sqlalchemy` dependencies**, which existed only for the
  previous JCR backend. `scitex-dev` becomes a core dependency in their place.

### Fixed
- **`Scholar.enrich_papers()`'s impact-factor path was dead code.** It called
  `ImpactFactorEngine.enrich_papers()`, a method that has never existed; the
  resulting `AttributeError` was caught and logged as "JCR engine unavailable
  ... falling back to calculation method" — a fallback that does not exist
  either. It now enriches papers, mirroring the pipeline's implementation.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- **`SCITEX_SCHOLAR_ALLOWED_HOSTS`** (comma-separated) for deployments the bind
  address alone does not cover -- a reverse proxy passing a DNS name, a MagicDNS
  name, several addresses at once.

### Changed
- **The Django UI renders inside scitex-ui's shared workspace shell.** scholar was
  the only leaf shipping its own `<html>` document; it now extends
  `scitex_ui/standalone_shell.html` like scitex-storage, scitex-writer and
  figrecipe, so it picks up the shared frame and theme. Block names were verified
  against the installed scitex-ui, not the source tree.
- The page title comes from `app_label`, which reads `SCITEX_APP_MODE`, so the
  browser tab alone distinguishes a hub-embedded instance from a standalone one.

### Fixed
- **Serving on any non-loopback address answered 400 to every request.**
  `ALLOWED_HOSTS` was a hardcoded loopback-only list with no way to extend it, so
  `gui serve --host <addr>` started cleanly, printed a correct-looking URL, and
  then rejected every caller with nothing in the banner to suggest why.
  `--host` now contributes its own address, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` switches on
  `DEBUG` (operator ruling): `["*"]` in development, loopback plus the explicit
  list otherwise. ANY DEPLOYMENT MUST SET `DJANGO_DEBUG=false` -- the permissive
  branch is the default branch and this app has no authentication of its own.
- **A template comment rendered as visible text across the top of the UI.**
  Django strips `{# ... #}` only on a SINGLE line; a multi-line one is emitted
  verbatim, and this template had a six-line explanatory comment above the
  stx-mount marker. Now `{% comment %}`. Found by the operator looking at the
  running page -- no test caught it, because the suite asserted that the right
  things were PRESENT and nothing asserted that wrong things were ABSENT.
- The GitHub Release step of the release pipeline no longer depends on the
  self-hosted runner's `gh` CLI, which aborts on a machine-local config before it
  ever reads its token.

### Internal
- Two regression tests pin that no raw template syntax reaches the browser, the
  second acting as a control so the pair cannot pass by rendering nothing.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- **The Django UI can be mounted under a path prefix.** Previously the app
  only worked at the site root: client code built root-absolute URLs
  (`/api/graph/...`) that 404 under any mount, and one call was
  prefix-*lucky* -- `fetch('api/search')` resolved correctly at `/scholar/`
  and broke at `/scholar`. The server now declares its mount point via
  scitex-app's `stx-mount` contract (`<meta name="stx-mount">`, fed by
  `mount_prefix(request)`), and every request joins it explicitly. Verified
  by booting the app at `/scholar/`, not by inspection (#113, #118).
- **Package search in the standalone GUI's Search tab** (#95).

### Changed
- **Design tokens come from scitex-ui instead of being shadowed locally.**
  Seven token definitions that silently overrode the shared theme were
  removed, so the app follows the ecosystem's light/dark palette (#115).
- The GUI adopts scitex-app's shared guarded launcher (#102), and the
  scitex-app dependency is now hard rather than silently optional (#111).

### Fixed
- **Every on-disk MCP handler raised `KeyError: 'scholar_dir'`.** Both
  scholar-directory helpers read `path_manager.dirs["scholar_dir"]`, a key
  that does not exist -- only the `.scholar_dir` attribute does. Nine call
  sites in `_mcp/handlers.py` and four in `mcp_server.py` failed before
  doing any work (#120).
- **An API key set exactly as the documentation instructs was ignored.**
  Scholar's own environment variables are now read under the documented
  `SCITEX_SCHOLAR_` prefix, with a deprecation warning on the legacy names
  (#109).
- **The app tile advertised version 0.1.0 while the package shipped 1.7.1.**
  The manifest declared a hand-written `version` that had drifted; it now
  derives from the installed distribution (#119).
- Importing a `_cli/*` group module first crashed on a cold interpreter --
  a `_cli/* <-> _cli_main` import cycle (#108).
- OA detection and journal normalization no longer crawl OpenAlex on the
  request hot path (#96, #97).
- `verify-cites` now requires a real identifier before classifying a
  citation VERIFIED; a title match alone was not enough (#81).
- The AGPL-3.0 "How to Apply" template text says **only**, matching the
  project's declared `AGPL-3.0-only` license (#66).

### Internal
- Test guards that were passing without testing anything: the import-graph
  guard parsed with `ast` instead of failing open (#114), and the design
  token guard now scans the template (where 11 tokens are used) and
  resolves `@import` instead of globbing a directory (#116, #117).

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- **Generated BibTeX files could be unparseable when a header comment contained
  a raw `@`.** BibTeX parsers locate entries by scanning for `@` and do not
  treat `%` as a comment introducer, so an `@` in a generated header line (an
  `@`-bearing source filename, an email address) was read as the start of a
  malformed entry and aborted the parse of an otherwise valid file. All writers
  now route their output through a single `sanitize_bibtex_comments()` choke
  point, which neutralizes `@` inside `%` lines while leaving entries and field
  values untouched.

### Changed
- `storage/BibTeXHandler.py` (previously 1155 lines) is split into mixins under
  `storage/_bibtex/` — parsing, writing, merging and project bibliographies —
  with `BibTeXHandler` as the thin composed class. Purely internal: the public
  import (`from scitex_scholar.storage import BibTeXHandler`) and the full method
  surface are unchanged.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Top-level facade for the search internals that downstream consumers
  depend on.** `ScholarSearchEngine` and `SearchQueryParser` are now
  importable directly from the package root
  (`from scitex_scholar import ScholarSearchEngine, SearchQueryParser`),
  so consumers can migrate off deep-internal paths
  (`scitex_scholar.search_engines.ScholarSearchEngine`,
  `scitex_scholar.pipelines.SearchQueryParser`). The deep paths keep
  working unchanged. A new import-contract regression test
  (`tests/integration/test_hub_import_contract.py`) asserts both the deep
  paths and the facade resolve, so any future relocation of these symbols
  fails loudly in CI rather than silently degrading a downstream consumer
  (e.g. scitex-hub's scholar_app, which deep-imports these).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **GUI: the Alt+I / Ctrl+I element inspector now loads.** The Django
  migration installed `scitex_ui` as an optional app for the shared
  workspace-shell assets but never wired its
  `ElementInspectorMiddleware`, so the visual DOM-debugging overlay
  silently did nothing. The middleware is now appended to `MIDDLEWARE`
  whenever `scitex_ui` is importable, matching the existing guarded
  `INSTALLED_APPS` append.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-12

### Changed
- **GUI: migrated the standalone browser interface from Flask to Django**,
  following `scitex-writer`'s reference pattern (`scitex_app.run_standalone`
  for the standalone server, guarded optional `scitex_ui` import for the
  shared favicon convention). The `scholar gui {open,serve,status,stop}`
  CLI surface is unchanged; only the backend swapped. Port 31297 unchanged.
  The Flask dependency is removed entirely (`django>=4.2` +
  `scitex-app>=0.2.8` replace it in the `[server]` extra). This is a
  standalone-only change -- it does not touch or replace scitex-hub's
  separate, independently-versioned `scholar_app`.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- `verify-cites`: a bare `eprint` (no `doi`) BibTeX/BibLaTeX field --
  what arXiv's own "export citation" produces -- was checked only as a
  boolean gate, then discarded, falling through to a keyword-based
  title search that could non-deterministically miss the real paper
  and cascade to an unreliable CrossRef title-search fallback (verified
  in one run, unverified in another). `eprint` is now canonicalized to
  an arXiv DOI and routed through the deterministic `id_list` lookup.
- `verify-cites`: `VERIFIED` now requires the resolution to have gone
  through a real identifier (doi/arxiv-id/corpus_id), never a bare
  title match, no matter how high the title-similarity score.
  CrossRef/OpenAlex's title index is not guaranteed stable across
  identical queries, so a title/author/year fuzzy match (reachable by
  any identifier-less citation) is not deterministic evidence.
  `ResolvedRef` gained `identifier_based: bool`; a title-only match now
  caps at `UNVERIFIED` with a provenance note explaining why.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- `ArXivEngine._search_by_doi` queried arXiv's API with the wrong field
  (`search_query=id:"..."`, a free-text search that silently returns
  zero entries for exact-ID lookups) instead of `id_list` (arXiv's
  documented direct-fetch parameter). Every DOI-form arXiv citation --
  the single most common citation form in ML/CS manuscripts -- fell
  through to the not-found fallback and could never classify VERIFIED
  in `verify-cites`, independent of the 1.5.0 `_std()` fix. Live-verified:
  a real arXiv DOI and a bare eprint id both now classify VERIFIED.
- `scitex_scholar.gui.launch()` crashed on startup with
  `KeyError: 'scholar_dir'` -- `PathManager.dirs` never had that key; the
  scholar root is exposed as the direct attribute `path_manager.scholar_dir`.
  The Scholar GUI (Flask app for browsing/managing the paper library) is
  reachable again.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- `verify-cites`: resolve every `\cite` key in a manuscript to a real
  source (CrossRef/OpenAlex/ArXiv/SemanticScholar) and gate on the
  result. Classifies each citation as verified / unverified / stub /
  hallucinated / unlinked. Available as
  `from scitex_scholar.verify_cites import verify_cites, compute_exit_code`
  and `python -m scitex_scholar.verify_cites <manuscript_dir> [options]`
  (not yet wired into the `scitex-scholar` CLI group, pending a
  `_cli_main.py` file-size-gate refactor).
- `verify-cites --emit-clew` now saves a clew-ingestible
  `citations/v1` sidecar (`{"schema": "scitex-clew/citations/v1", ...}`)
  via `stx.io.save` instead of importing/calling `scitex_clew` directly,
  keeping scholar clew-agnostic per the ecosystem's acyclic-deps
  decision (2026-07-02).

### Fixed
- `verify-cites`'s resolver (`_std()`) read the wrong metadata dict
  shape (flat `title`/`doi` instead of the real engines' nested
  `basic.title`/`id.doi`), so it could never classify a citation as
  VERIFIED via any online path -- every real, correctly-cited paper
  silently degraded to UNVERIFIED. Fixed, with a guard so a
  not-found title-search echo (CrossRef/OpenAlex/ArXiv's
  `_create_minimal_metadata` fallback) cannot self-match into a false
  VERIFIED. Live-verified against a real DOI (now resolves VERIFIED)
  and a fabricated title (still resolves to no hit).
- `ScholarAuthManager` no longer hard-fails with `AuthenticationError`
  when no institutional auth provider is configured -- open-access
  paper fetches (arXiv, etc.) now proceed anonymously instead of
  blocking every browser-based download behind an OpenAthens/EZProxy/
  Shibboleth login nobody set up.
- Journal-name sanitization in `update_symlink()` no longer crashes
  with `AttributeError` (`path_manager._sanitize_filename` was never a
  real method) -- `paper fetch --project <name>` now actually creates
  the project symlink for papers with a journal name, instead of
  silently reporting success while skipping the link.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- `ensure_workspace` is now exported at the package top level
  (`from scitex_scholar import ensure_workspace`). Previously missing from
  `__all__`/the lazy-import map, so the name silently resolved to the
  submodule instead of the function, breaking any caller expecting a
  callable (scitex-hub prod incident: scitex-template's
  `clone_scitex_minimal` -> `TypeError: 'module' object is not callable`).
- Search result `title`/`abstract` fields are now sanitized of raw
  JATS/HTML markup (`<jats:p>`, `<scp>...</scp>`, `<jats:title>`, ...) at
  `standardize_metadata()`, the single choke point every metadata engine
  (CrossRef, CrossRefLocal, OpenAlex, PubMed, Semantic Scholar, arXiv, ...)
  funnels through. Previously these tags leaked into consumer UIs
  (reported by the scitex-hub webapp).

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- `scitex-dev ecosystem audit-all` is now fully clean (0 errors, 0 warnings).
  - **MCP §6**: declared `[tool.scitex_dev] mcp_parity_exempt` — scitex-scholar
    is a service/workflow package whose MCP tool surface intentionally differs
    from its pure-function public API.
  - **PA-305**: moved type-hint-only `playwright.async_api` imports (728
    modules, incl. ~708 Zotero-style translators) under `if TYPE_CHECKING:`;
    added `capture_debug_artifacts_async` to the 16 modules that genuinely
    drive a browser (auth/browser infra + translator demos).

### Changed
- Require `scitex-browser>=0.1.15` (first release exporting
  `capture_debug_artifacts_async`).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added — Library workflow

- **`library refresh [PROJECT] [--sync HOST]`** — one-button maintenance
  umbrella: reconcile `container.projects` ↔ filesystem symlinks, then
  regenerate every readable name (`PDF-NN_CC-..._IF-..._...`) via the
  canonical `LibraryManager.update_symlink`, then optional rsync push
  to one or more remote hosts. Each refresh + sync is recorded in
  `library/<project>/info/project_metadata.json`. Subsumes the
  previous `reconcile-projects` and `refresh-symlinks` standalone
  commands (removed; helpers remain as Python API).

- **`library list [PROJECT]`** — positional project arg auto-enables
  per-paper detail (still configurable via `-v` / `-vv` / `-vvv`).

- **`library bind PROJECT PROJECT-DIR`** — single-symlink view of the
  home library inside a project repo
  (`<project-dir>/.scitex/scholar/library/<project>` → `~/.scitex/scholar/library/<project>`).
  No data movement, no MASTER passthrough. `--unbind` removes the
  symlink. Verbless shorthand `library <project> <project-dir>`
  triggers when `<project>` already exists in home.

- **`library sync HOST [--remote-path PATH] [--pull] [--delete]`** —
  rsync the library to/from a remote host. `--remote-path` overrides
  the default `.scitex/scholar/library/[<project>/]`; `--copy-links`
  (default) follows symlinks for self-contained remote dirs.

- **`library export PROJECT --format <bibtex|tarball|flat-pdfs|zotero>`** —
  portable export. Default location:
  `~/.scitex/scholar/exports/<project>-<ts>.<ext>` (or under
  `<project-dir>/.scitex/scholar/exports/` when bound).

- **`library audit-files [--project P] [--no-rehash]`** — verify
  recorded files against disk: missing / orphan / hash_mismatch.
  Reads the new `metadata.path.files` registry (role + sha256 + size +
  added_at + source) populated by `paper fetch --pdf-*`.

- **`library zotero {import, export, diff}`** — bidirectional Zotero
  migration scaffold (engine in `integration/zotero/local_migrator.py`
  was already present; CLI verbs landed). **Marked as future work**
  — verify on a real round-trip before relying on it; tracked in
  `GITIGNORED/TODO.md`.

- **Categorized `--help`** at top level (`[Workflow] / [Dev]`) and on
  the `library` group (`[Daily] / [Layout] / [Share] / [Database]`),
  via a private `_CategorizedGroup` Click subclass.

### Added — Paper fetch (manual PDF import)

- **`paper fetch --pdf-main <path>`** (back-compat alias `--pdf`) —
  skip the browser/download stack and consume a user-provided main
  PDF. Metadata enrichment from `--doi`/`--title` still runs.
- **`paper fetch --pdf-supple <path>` (repeatable)** — supplementary
  files placed at `MASTER/<id>/supple-<original_name>`.
- **`paper fetch --attachment <path>` (repeatable)** — attachments
  placed at `MASTER/<id>/additional-<original_name>`.
- **`--doi` accepts URL form** — `https://doi.org/...`,
  `http://dx.doi.org/...`, `doi:10.x/y` all normalize.
- **DOI auto-extraction from PDF page-1** when `--pdf-main` is given
  without `--doi`/`--title`.
- **DOI mismatch warning** — after a `--pdf-main` import the page-1
  DOI is checked against `metadata.id.doi`; mismatch is logged
  loudly. Catches the kind of file-swap that crossed Maturana 2020 ↔
  Karoly 2019 last session.
- **Main PDF immutability** — `_step_07_import_files` `chmod 444`s
  the main PDF on import (Zotero-style: canonical record-of-paper
  stays read-only; annotated copies live alongside). Recorded as
  `"immutable": true` in `metadata.path.files`.

### Added — Browser-watch import (`library open-urls --watch`)

(The browser-side improvements landed across this session — listed
here for completeness; underlying engine already merged.)

- Tab-origin matching: every tab's `paper_id` is cached so a download
  from a known tab maps to the right paper without filename guessing.
- Popup tab inheritance via `Page.opener()` (publisher download
  buttons that spawn a new tab now carry the parent's paper_id).
- Dual watch dirs: Playwright's intercepted dir
  (`~/.scitex/scholar/cache/chrome/playwright_downloads/<session>/`)
  AND `~/Downloads`, so WSL→Windows mounts that block inotify don't
  prevent detection.
- SSO cookie injection: `~/.scitex/scholar/cache/auth/<provider>.json`
  is loaded and injected into the Playwright context before
  navigation, so paywalled URLs hit the authenticated session.
- Live event pump via `page.wait_for_timeout(1000)` (sync Playwright
  needed an explicit pump; events were arriving only on browser
  close).
- Colored output via `scitex-logging`; debug log file at
  `~/.scitex/scholar/cache/debug/watch_sessions/<session>/session.log`.
- Human-readable labels (`Smith 2020 Scientific Reports`) instead of
  paper-ids in user-facing log lines.

### Fixed

- **`.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml`** — workflow YAML was
  malformed (duplicate keys + `needs: build` referencing a
  non-existent `build` job), so every push to `develop` triggered a
  zero-second failed run. Restructured into three sequenced jobs
  (`build` → `publish` → `release`) with consistent `inputs.version
  || github.ref` resolution; `release` job tolerates re-runs via
  `gh release create … || gh release upload --clobber`.
- **`_step_01_normalize_as_doi`** — accept `doi:`/`https://doi.org/`/
  `http://dx.doi.org/`/`https://www.doi.org/` URL forms; trim
  query/fragment.

### Internal

- New `metadata.path.files` registry (list of
  `{role, name, sha256, size, added_at, source, immutable}` entries)
  is the source of truth for `library audit-files`. Legacy
  `metadata.path.{pdfs, supplementary_files, additional_files}` are
  kept in sync for back-compat readers.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **`scitex_scholar._mcp_server`** — FastMCP server exposing every handler in
  `_mcp.all_handlers` as a `scholar_<verb>_<noun>` MCP tool, plus the per-§5
  required `scholar_skills_list` / `scholar_skills_get` introspection tools.
  Discoverable as `scitex_scholar._mcp_server.mcp` by `scitex-dev ecosystem
  audit-mcp-tools`. Replaces the legacy `scitex_scholar.mcp_server` (still
  shipped, deprecation-warning-only).

### Fixed (skills audit clearance)
- **§1d vocabulary**: `lookup` moved from `nouns` to `transitive_verbs` in
  `.scitex/dev/cli-audit-dict.yaml` (was `verbs`, which is not a key the
  auditor recognises). `library db lookup` now passes §1d.
- **§2 read-verb `--json`**: added `--json` flag to `skills get`.
- **§11 argparse residue**: replaced the only remaining `argparse.Namespace`
  use in `_cli_main.py` with `types.SimpleNamespace` (compat shim for
  `pdf_highlight._cli.run` which still takes a Namespace-shaped object).
- **SK109**: renumbered skill leaves so `05_mcp-tools.md` exists at the
  expected slot (was `09_mcp-tools.md`); `api-overview` shifted to `06`.
- **PS204**: extracted Click app from `__main__.py` to `_cli_main.py` so the
  test mirror `tests/scitex_scholar/test__cli_main.py` resolves to a unique
  src file (was: 3 `__main__.py` files share basename, regex blind spot).
  `__main__.py` is now a thin shim.

### Known (architectural divergence — won't fix)
- audit-mcp-tools §6 reports 12 Python APIs without MCP-tool matches and 24
  MCP tools without Python-API matches. The two surfaces are deliberately
  different shapes: the Python API exposes facade classes (`Scholar`,
  `Paper`, `Papers`, `ScholarConfig`), the MCP API exposes per-operation
  tools (`scholar_search_papers`, `scholar_resolve_dois`, …). Aligning them
  would require collapsing the API or fragmenting the MCP surface — neither
  is desirable.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### BREAKING — CLI noun-verb grammar refactor

The CLI top-level commands have been regrouped under noun-verb groups to comply
with the SciTeX subcommand grammar standard
(`~/.claude/skills/scitex/general/03_interface_02_cli/02_subcommand-structure-noun-verb.md`).

The pre-1.3.0 top-level forms still work but emit a one-line `DeprecationWarning`
on stderr and will be **removed in 1.4.0**.

#### Migration

| Old (deprecated, emits DeprecationWarning) | New (1.3.0+)                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `scitex-scholar single …`                  | `scitex-scholar paper fetch …`               |
| `scitex-scholar parallel …`                | `scitex-scholar paper fetch-batch …`         |
| `scitex-scholar bibtex --bibtex …`         | `scitex-scholar bibtex import --bibtex …`    |
| `scitex-scholar highlight …`               | `scitex-scholar pdf highlight …`             |
| `scitex-scholar link-project-tree …`       | `scitex-scholar library link-project-tree …` |
| `scitex-scholar materialize …`             | `scitex-scholar library materialize …`       |
| `scitex-scholar dematerialize …`           | `scitex-scholar library dematerialize …`     |
| `scitex-scholar db {build,migrate,lookup,list,audit}` | `scitex-scholar library db {build,migrate,lookup,list,audit}` |
| `scitex-scholar mcp {start,list-tools,doctor,install}` | _(unchanged — already noun-verb)_ |

Old and new forms route to the same handler, so behaviour is identical.

### Added (CLI ecosystem compliance)

- **Click migration** — CLI rewritten in Click (was: argparse). Matches the canonical SciTeX framework; unlocks shared infrastructure (`--help-recursive`, ecosystem-wide `--json`).
- **Cold-start latency** — `import scitex_scholar` is now ~64ms (was 4.5s) via PEP 562 lazy `__getattr__` in `__init__.py`. Tab-completion latency drops by ~70×.
- **Universal flags at top level**: `-V/--version`, `--help-recursive`, `--json`.
- **New top-level commands**:
  - `list-python-apis` — print public callables in `scitex_scholar.__all__`.
  - `skills {list, get, install}` — list / read / install bundled skill leaves.
- **Per-leaf flags**:
  - Mutating verbs (`paper fetch`, `paper fetch-batch`, `bibtex import`, `pdf highlight`, `library link-project-tree`, `library materialize`, `library dematerialize`, `library db build`, `mcp start`, `mcp install`): `--dry-run`, `--yes/-y`.
  - Read verbs (`mcp list-tools`, `library db list`, `library db lookup`, `library db audit`, `skills list`, `list-python-apis`): `--json`.
  - Every leaf has a concrete `Example:` block in `--help`.
- `.scitex/dev/cli-audit-dict.yaml` — vocabulary entries for `bibtex`, `pdf`, `lookup`, `dedupe`.

### Fixed

- **PS102** — Removed orphan visible `./scitex/` directory at repo root (held a stale `clew.db`; the live state lives in hidden `.scitex/`).
- **PS204** — Renamed `tests/scitex_scholar/cli/test_noun_verb_grammar.py` → `tests/scitex_scholar/cli/test___main__.py` to mirror its src file.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **CLI no-args UX**: `scitex-scholar` (no subcommand) now prints help and exits 0
  instead of `error: the following arguments are required: command` (exit 2).
- **CLI prog name**: was `python -m scitex.scholar` (legacy/wrong namespace);
  now `scitex-scholar`, matching the installed entry point.
- **Sphinx strict build**: 38 warnings → 0. Adds previously-unlinked toctree
  entries (`api/index`, `cli`, `mcp`, `quickstart`, `semantic_highlight`),
  fixes Numpy-style docstring formatting in `Papers.filter`, `Papers.sort_by`,
  `Scholar.__init__`, `apply_filters`, `ScholarConfig.__dir__/__getattr__`.
- **`.readthedocs.yaml`**: `fail_on_warning: false` → `true` to prevent regression.

### Added
- **CLI `scitex-scholar mcp list-tools`**: print the MCP tool names this package
  registers (`scholar_*`) without starting the server. Introspection helper.

### Changed (community-project compliance)
- Drop `__email__` from `scitex_scholar.__init__`; scrub `ywatanabe@scitex.ai`
  from package-shipped READMEs and the BibTeX export comment header (CLA legal
  block in `CLA.md` retained).
- README skill links now point at the published RTD pages instead of internal
  `src/scitex_scholar/_skills/...` paths that don't resolve for pip-installed
  users.
- README CLI examples standardized on `scitex-scholar <subcommand>` form.
- Drop duplicate skill leaves under `_skills/scitex-scholar/`: merged
  `06_quick-start.md`, `07_python-api.md`, `08_cli-reference.md` content into
  the canonical `02/03/04` leaves.
- `_skills/scitex-scholar/05_api-overview.md`: drop redundant `scitex-scholar`
  tag (slug-form-only per SK710).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **`db build` no longer fails with a uniqueness violation on `papers.doi` when multiple MASTER entries have `doi=""` (empty string).** The unique-DOI constraint treated an absent DOI as distinct per row, but empty string is a real value and multiple of them collided. `_row_from_metadata` now normalizes empty and whitespace-only DOI / arxiv_id / pmid to `None` before insert, matching the semantic intent ("no ID"). Regression test added.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **CLI `db dedupe`** — resolve duplicate-DOI entries in MASTER. Scores candidates by a reproducible rubric (`+10` PDF, `+1` per populated `basic.*` field, `+1` per populated `id.*` field, `+log(1+citation_count)` capped at 5, `mtime` tiebreaker). Losers move to `MASTER_quarantine/<paper_id>/` by default (reversible) or can be `--hard-delete`d. Dry-run by default; `--apply` executes. Output shows per-group scores so users see *why* each winner was picked. Idempotent on re-run. Completes the audit → dedupe → build workflow surfaced by issue #12. (PR #15)

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **Atomic `metadata.json` / `tables.json` writes** (`PaperIO.save_metadata`, `PaperIO.save_tables`). Previous implementation was a plain `open("w") + json.dump`, which left behind truncated files if the process was killed mid-write. One such victim (paper_id `3DD203D4`) was surfaced by `db audit`. New implementation writes to a `.tmp` sibling, `flush` + `fsync`, then `os.replace`s into place — readers always see either the previous valid JSON or the new valid JSON, never a half-written file. 8 unit tests cover roundtrip, overwrite, mid-write crash simulation, and cleanup-on-failure.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **CLI `db audit`** — read-only library anomaly report (closes #12). Walks `MASTER/` and decorated symlinks, reporting duplicate DOIs, unparseable `metadata.json`, missing/unreferenced PDFs, missing DOIs (informational), and orphaned decorated symlinks. Human-readable by default; `--json` for tooling. Exits `0` always unless `--strict` is passed. Pure filesystem read; no DB writes. Unblocks users whose `db build` raises on duplicate DOIs — they can audit first, fix, then rebuild.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **CLI `link-project-tree <dir>`** — creates `<dir>/.scitex/scholar/library → ~/.scitex/scholar/library/` as an idempotent absolute symlink. `--force` replaces a differing target. See [ADR-100](docs/adr/0100-project-tree-link.md). (PR #4)
- **CLI `materialize <link_path> --bib <bib>`** — replaces a library-symlink with a real directory containing only the `MASTER/<paper_id>/` subtrees for DOIs cited in `<bib>`. Useful for tarball handoff. (PR #5)
- **CLI `dematerialize <path> [--target <dir>]`** — inverse of `materialize`: deletes the real directory and replaces it with a symlink to `~/.scitex/scholar/library` (or `--target`). (PR #5)
- **CLI `db {build, migrate, lookup, list}`** — Zotero-style index at `<library_root>/index.db` for fast paper lookup. Schema v1 exposes `paper_id, doi, arxiv_id, pmid, title, year, venue, is_oa, authors_json, abstract, citation_count, updated_at`. Consumers read the index file directly — no Python dependency on `scitex-scholar`. (PR #6)
- **ADR-100** documenting the project-tree link + materialize lifecycle (filesystem-as-API contract, additive-only `metadata.json` schema, `MASTER/<paper_id>/` layout). (PR #4)
- `[tool.pyright]` configuration in `pyproject.toml` with `typeCheckingMode = basic`, targeted excludes, and justified rule suppressions for the false-alert-dominated categories on this codebase. (PR #8)
- `Part of SciTeX` / Four Freedoms footer to README.

### Changed

- `library-index-db` (PR #6): `build()` now **fails loudly** on duplicate DOIs in MASTER instead of silently overwriting (the previous `INSERT OR REPLACE` masked library corruption).
- `library-index-db` (PR #6): `build()` now writes to a temp file and atomically swaps, so a failed rebuild preserves the existing DB.
- Repo-wide ruff cleanup: 806 → 0 errors. 27 real bugs fixed (missing `import re` in `dpla.py`; classmethod `self.` → `cls.__name__` in `registry.py`; `TYPE_CHECKING` imports for `Paper`/`Papers`/`OAResult`; duplicate dict key in `OpenAlexEngine`; redefined functions in `manual_download_utils`; `type() ==` → `type() is` in `_CascadeConfig`; etc.). (PR #7)
- Repo-wide pyright cleanup: 1,577 → 0 errors with `basic` mode + real fixes across 49 files. (PR #8)

### Fixed

- `core/_mixins/_savers.py`: broken relative import `..storage` → `...storage` (would have raised `ImportError` at module load on any live path). (PR #8)
- `core/Papers.py`: bibtex parsing body incorrectly nested inside an `if "year" in fields:` guard — restored correct flow. (PR #8)

### Removed

- Dead ZenRows proxy code path — `use_zenrows_proxy` was a threaded constructor parameter that never evaluated truthy; import of a non-existent `browser/remote/ZenRowsProxyManager` module lived behind the `if` branch. Removed the parameter from `ScholarBrowserManager.__init__` and its two CLI call sites.
- Broken `impact_factor/estimation/` subtree — imported a non-existent `fetchers` module; `ImpactFactorCalculator` was unreachable in practice. The live `impact_factor/ImpactFactorEngine.py` and `impact_factor/jcr/` are unaffected.
- Hidden `metadata_engines/.combined-SemanticScholarSource/` backup directory.
