# Changelog

All notable changes to `scitex-scholar` are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **`db build` no longer raises `sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: papers.doi` when multiple MASTER entries have `doi=""` (empty string).** The `UNIQUE(doi) WHERE doi IS NOT NULL` index treats NULL as distinct per row, but empty string is a real value and multiple of them collided. `_row_from_metadata` now normalizes empty and whitespace-only DOI / arxiv_id / pmid to `None` before insert, matching the semantic intent ("no ID"). Regression test added.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **CLI `db dedupe`** — resolve duplicate-DOI entries in MASTER. Scores candidates by a reproducible rubric (`+10` PDF, `+1` per populated `basic.*` field, `+1` per populated `id.*` field, `+log(1+citation_count)` capped at 5, `mtime` tiebreaker). Losers move to `MASTER_quarantine/<paper_id>/` by default (reversible) or can be `--hard-delete`d. Dry-run by default; `--apply` executes. Output shows per-group scores so users see *why* each winner was picked. Idempotent on re-run. Completes the audit → dedupe → build workflow surfaced by issue #12. (PR #15)

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **Atomic `metadata.json` / `tables.json` writes** (`PaperIO.save_metadata`, `PaperIO.save_tables`). Previous implementation was a plain `open("w") + json.dump`, which left behind truncated files if the process was killed mid-write. One such victim (paper_id `3DD203D4`) was surfaced by `db audit`. New implementation writes to a `.tmp` sibling, `flush` + `fsync`, then `os.replace`s into place — readers always see either the previous valid JSON or the new valid JSON, never a half-written file. 8 unit tests cover roundtrip, overwrite, mid-write crash simulation, and cleanup-on-failure.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **CLI `db audit`** — read-only library anomaly report (closes #12). Walks `MASTER/` and decorated symlinks, reporting duplicate DOIs, unparseable `metadata.json`, missing/unreferenced PDFs, missing DOIs (informational), and orphaned decorated symlinks. Human-readable by default; `--json` for tooling. Exits `0` always unless `--strict` is passed. Pure filesystem read; no DB writes. Unblocks users whose `db build` raises on duplicate DOIs — they can audit first, fix, then rebuild.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **CLI `link-project-tree <dir>`** — creates `<dir>/.scitex/scholar/library → ~/.scitex/scholar/library/` as an idempotent absolute symlink. `--force` replaces a differing target. See [ADR-100](docs/architecture/ADR-100-project-tree-link.md). (PR #4)
- **CLI `materialize <link_path> --bib <bib>`** — replaces a library-symlink with a real directory containing only the `MASTER/<paper_id>/` subtrees for DOIs cited in `<bib>`. Useful for tarball handoff. (PR #5)
- **CLI `dematerialize <path> [--target <dir>]`** — inverse of `materialize`: deletes the real directory and replaces it with a symlink to `~/.scitex/scholar/library` (or `--target`). (PR #5)
- **CLI `db {build, migrate, lookup, list}`** — Zotero-style SQLite index at `<library_root>/index.db` for fast paper lookup. Schema v1 exposes `paper_id, doi, arxiv_id, pmid, title, year, venue, is_oa, authors_json, abstract, citation_count, updated_at`. Consumers read the DB directly with sqlite3 — no Python dependency on `scitex-scholar`. (PR #6)
- **ADR-100** documenting the project-tree link + materialize lifecycle (filesystem-as-API contract, additive-only `metadata.json` schema, `MASTER/<paper_id>/` layout). (PR #4)
- `[tool.pyright]` configuration in `pyproject.toml` with `typeCheckingMode = basic`, targeted excludes, and justified rule suppressions for the false-alert-dominated categories on this codebase. (PR #8)
- `Part of SciTeX` / Four Freedoms footer to README.

### Changed

- `library-index-db` (PR #6): `build()` now **fails loudly** on duplicate DOIs in MASTER instead of silently overwriting (the previous `INSERT OR REPLACE` masked library corruption).
- `library-index-db` (PR #6): `build()` now writes to a temp file and atomically swaps, so a failed rebuild preserves the existing DB.
- Repo-wide ruff cleanup: 806 → 0 errors. 27 real bugs fixed (missing `import re` in `dpla.py`; classmethod `self.` → `cls.__name__` in `registry.py`; `TYPE_CHECKING` imports for `Paper`/`Papers`/`OAResult`; duplicate dict key in `OpenAlexEngine`; redefined functions in `manual_download_utils`; `type() ==` → `type() is` in `_CascadeConfig`; etc.). (PR #7)
- Repo-wide pyright cleanup: 1,577 → 0 errors with `basic` mode + real fixes across 49 files. (PR #8)

### Fixed

- `core/_mixins/_savers.py`: broken relative import `..storage` → `...storage` (would have raised `ImportError` at module load on any live path). (PR #8)
- `core/Papers.py`: bibtex parsing body incorrectly nested inside an `if "year" in fields:` guard — restored correct flow. (PR #8)

### Removed

- Dead ZenRows proxy code path — `use_zenrows_proxy` was a threaded constructor parameter that never evaluated truthy; import of a non-existent `browser/remote/ZenRowsProxyManager` module lived behind the `if` branch. Removed the parameter from `ScholarBrowserManager.__init__` and its two CLI call sites.
- Broken `impact_factor/estimation/` subtree — imported a non-existent `fetchers` module; `ImpactFactorCalculator` was unreachable in practice. The live `impact_factor/ImpactFactorEngine.py` and `impact_factor/jcr/` are unaffected.
- Hidden `metadata_engines/.combined-SemanticScholarSource/` backup directory.
