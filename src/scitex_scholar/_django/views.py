Ports the Flask-era `scitex_scholar.gui._app` (`index`, `health`) and
`scitex_scholar.gui._routes_graph` (`graph_network`, `graph_related`,
`graph_paper`, `graph_health`) views verbatim in behaviour: same query
param validation, same in-memory TTL cache, same HTTP status codes
(400/404/500/503), same JSON response shapes. Only the framework
plumbing changes: `request.args` -> `request.GET`, `jsonify` -> Django
`JsonResponse`, `current_app.config` -> `django.conf.settings`.

`search` has no Flask-era ancestor: it is a new adapter over the
package's `ScholarSearchEngine` facade, which is the single source of
truth for search. No search logic lives here.

    trustworthy for a DEPLOYED (non-editable) install, which is the case it
