2. Make Your First Request
Start with a simple request to understand how the Scraping Browser works with Playwright. We’ll use the E-commerce Challenge page to demonstrate how to connect to the browser and extract the page title.

Python

Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
# pip install playwright
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

# scraping browser connection URL
connection_url = "wss://browser.zenrows.com?apikey=YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY"

async def scrape_asyncr_async():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        # connect to the scraping browser
        browser = await p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(connection_url)
        context = browser.contexts[0] if browser.contexts else await browser.new_context()
        page = await context.new_page()

        await page.goto('https://www.scrapingcourse.com/ecommerce/')
        print(await page.title())

        await browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(scrape_asyncr_async())
Replace YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY with your actual API key and run the script:

Python

Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
# pip install playwright
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

# scraping browser connection URL
connection_url = "wss://browser.zenrows.com?apikey=YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY"

async def scrape_asyncr_async(url):
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        # connect to the scraping browser
        browser = await p.chromium.connect_over_cdp(connection_url)
        page = await browser.new_page()

        try:
            await page.goto(url)

            # extract the desired data
            await page.wait_for_selector(".product")
            products = await page.query_selector_all(".product")
            data = []

            for product in products:
                name = await product.query_selector(".product-name")
                price = await product.query_selector(".price")
                product_url = await product.query_selector(".woocommerce-LoopProduct-link")

                data.append({
                    "name": await name.text_content() or "",
                    "price": await price.text_content() or "",
                    "productURL": await product_url.get_attribute("href") or "",
                })

            return data
        except Exception as error:
            return error
        finally:
            await page.close()
            await browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = "https://www.scrapingcourse.com/ecommerce/"
    products = asyncio.run(scrape_asyncr_async(url))
    print(products)
​
Run Your Application
Execute your script to test the scraping functionality:

Congratulations! 🎉 You’ve successfully built a real-world scraping scenario with Playwright and the ZenRows Scraping Browser.
​
4. Alternative: Using the ZenRows Browser SDK
For a more streamlined development experience, you can use the ZenRows Browser SDK instead of managing WebSocket URLs manually. The SDK simplifies connection management and provides additional utilities.
The ZenRows Browser SDK is currently only available for JavaScript. For more details, see the GitHub Repository.
​
Install the SDK
Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
npm install @zenrows/browser-sdk
​
Quick Migration from WebSocket URL
If you have existing Playwright code using the WebSocket connection, migrating to the SDK requires minimal changes:
Before (WebSocket URL):
Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const connectionURL = 'wss://browser.zenrows.com?apikey=YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY';

const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(connectionURL);
After (SDK):
Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const { ScrapingBrowser } = require('@zenrows/browser-sdk');

const scrapingBrowser = new ScrapingBrowser({ apiKey: 'YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY' });
const connectionURL = scrapingBrowser.getConnectURL();
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(connectionURL);
​
Complete Example with SDK
Node.js

Copy

Ask AI
// npm install @zenrows/browser-sdk playwright
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const { ScrapingBrowser } = require('@zenrows/browser-sdk');

const scrape_asyncr_async = async () => {
    // Initialize SDK
    const scrapingBrowser = new ScrapingBrowser({ apiKey: 'YOUR_ZENROWS_API_KEY' });
    const connectionURL = scrapingBrowser.getConnectURL();

    const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(connectionURL);
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.goto('https://www.scrapingcourse.com/ecommerce/');
    console.log(await page.title());

    await browser.close();
};

scrape_asyncr_async();

​
Troubleshooting
Below are common issues you might encounter when using Playwright with the Scraping Browser:
1
Connection Refused

If you receive a Connection Refused error, it might be due to:
API Key Issues: Verify that you’re using the correct API key.
Network Issues: Check your internet connection and firewall settings.
WebSocket Endpoint: Ensure that the WebSocket URL (wss://browser.zenrows.com) is correct.
2
Empty Data or Timeout Errors

Use page.waitForSelector() to ensure elements load before extraction
Increase timeout values for slow-loading pages
scrape_asyncr_async.js

Copy

Ask AI
await page.goto('https://example.com', { timeout: 60000 });  // 60 seconds
Verify CSS selectors are correct using browser developer tools
Add page.waitForLoadState('networkidle') for dynamic content
3
Browser Context Issues

Use existing context when available: browser.contexts[0] if browser.contexts else await browser.new_context()
Properly close pages and browsers to prevent resource leaks
Handle exceptions properly to ensure cleanup occurs
4
Geolocation Blocks

Although ZenRows rotates IPs, some websites may block them based on location. Try adjusting the region or country settings.
For more information, check our Scraping Browser Region Documentation and Country Documentation.
