Of course. It's easy to get lost when an automated process creates many files. Your agent is working hard but has made one critical mistake that is causing all the timeouts and confusion.

Here is the suggestion to get everything working.

The Core Problem: Separating Authentication from Action
Your agent's critical mistake is that it's running the authentication in one script, and then trying to run the DOI resolution in a separate, second script.

An authenticate_async session (your login "cookie") only exists for the script that creates it. When the first script finishes, the session is gone. The second script starts fresh, unauthenticate_async, and immediately hits the login wall, causing it to time out.

Analogy: It's like buying a concert ticket 🎟️ online, closing your browser, then show_asyncing up to the concert gate with nothing in your hand and expecting them to know you bought a ticket. You need to use the ticket (the authenticate_async session) in the same process where you acquired it.

The Solution: One Consolidated Script
The solution is to use a single script that performs both steps in the correct order:

Authenticate first.

Then, using that same authenticate_async session, resolve the DOIs.

Please have your agent delete the other test scripts (check_doi_resolution.py, interactive_auth_and_resolve.py, debug_auth_session.py, etc.) 🗑️.

Use this single, clean script as the correct way forward.

New File Suggestion: run_full_workflow.py
Python

#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
A single, consolidated script to perform the full workflow:
1. Authenticate using a local, visible browser with ZenRows proxy.
2. Resolve a list of DOIs using the authenticate_async session.

import os
import asyncio
from scitex.scholar.open_url import OpenURLResolver
from scitex.scholar.auth import ScholarAuthManager
from scitex import logging

# Set up logging to see what's happening
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

async def main():
    """Main execution function."""

    # 1. Initialize the Authentication Manager
    # This will use the local browser + ZenRows proxy method.
    auth_manager = ScholarAuthManager(
        email_openathens=os.getenv("SCITEX_SCHOLAR_OPENATHENS_EMAIL")
    )

    # 2. Authenticate
    # This will open a local browser window. You must complete the login manually.
    # The script will wait until you have successfully logged in.
    logger.info("Starting authentication process...")
    await auth_manager.ensure_authenticate_async()
    logger.success("Authentication successful! Session is now active.")

    # 3. Initialize the OpenURL Resolver WITH the authenticate_async manager
    # It will automatically use the same browser and session.
    resolver = OpenURLResolver(
        auth_manager=auth_manager,
        resolver_url=os.getenv("SCITEX_SCHOLAR_OPENURL_RESOLVER_URL"),
    )

    dois_to_resolve = [
        "10.1002/hipo.22488",        # Wiley
        "10.1038/nature12373",      # Nature
        "10.1016/j.neuron.2018.01.048", # Elsevier
        "10.1126/science.1172133",      # Science
        "10.1073/pnas.0608765104",      # PNAS (often has strong bot detection)
    ]

    # 4. Resolve DOIs using the now-authenticate_async session
    logger.info(f"Attempting to resolve {len(dois_to_resolve)} DOIs...")

    # Use the synchronous wrapper for simplicity here
    results = resolver.resolve(dois_to_resolve)

    logger.info("--- Resolution Complete ---")
    for doi, result in zip(dois_to_resolve, results):
        if result and result.get("success"):
            logger.success(f"{doi} -> {result.get('final_url')}")
        else:
            logger.error(f"✗ {doi} -> FAILED ({result.get('access_type', 'Unknown Error')})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This allows running the async main function
    asyncio.run(main())
This single script correctly chains the authentication and resolution steps, which will solve the timeout issues.
