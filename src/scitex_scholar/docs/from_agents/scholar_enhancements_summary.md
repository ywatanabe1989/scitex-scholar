### Completed Enhancements

#### 1. Fixed PDF Download Return Value Issue ✅
**Problem**: `Scholar.download_pdf_asyncs()` was returning an empty Papers collection even though PDFs were downloading successfully.

**Solution**:
- Added logic to create Paper objects when DOI strings are provided as input
- Properly maps download PDFs back to Paper objects
- Returns a populated Papers collection with pdf_path set for successful downloads

**Code changes**: `_Scholar.py` lines 445-470

#### 2. Enhanced OpenAthens Authentication with Email Auto-fill ✅
**Problem**: Users had to manually type their institutional email in the OpenAthens login form.

**Solution**:
- Implemented automatic email field detection and filling
- Uses multiple CSS selectors to find the email input field
- Types with human-like delay for better compatibility
- Triggers autocomplete dropdown after filling
- Shows "(auto-filled)" in instructions when email is provided

**Code changes**: `_OpenAthensAuthenticator.py` lines 218-264

#### 3. Fixed Environment Variable Naming Convention ✅
**Problem**: Some environment variables in the default config YAML were missing the SCITEX_SCHOLAR_ prefix.

**Solution**:
- Updated all environment variable references to use consistent SCITEX_SCHOLAR_ prefix
- Added missing configuration options for OpenAthens and auto-download features
- Updated documentation in default_config.yaml

**Files changed**:
- `config/default_config.yaml`

### Configuration Methods Supported

The OpenAthens email can now be configured in three ways (priority order):
1. **Direct parameter**: `scholar.configure_openathens(email="your.email@institution.edu")`
2. **YAML config file**: `openathens_email: "your.email@institution.edu"`
3. **Environment variable**: `SCITEX_SCHOLAR_OPENATHENS_EMAIL="your.email@institution.edu"`

### Testing

Created comprehensive test scripts to verify:
- PDF download functionality with proper Papers collection return
- OpenAthens email auto-fill with all configuration methods
- Configuration priority (direct > YAML > environment)

### Impact

- Improved user experience with automatic email filling during authentication
- Fixed critical bug where download PDFs weren't accessible in the returned Papers collection
- Consistent environment variable naming prevents conflicts with other packages
- Better configuration documentation for users

### Next Steps

1. Update unit tests to include new OpenAthens attributes in mock objects
2. Test with real institutional credentials to verify auto-fill works across different OpenAthens implementations
3. Consider adding support for other authentication methods (EZProxy, Shibboleth) following the same pattern
