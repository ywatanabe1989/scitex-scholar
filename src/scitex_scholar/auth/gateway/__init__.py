Authentication Gateway Module

This module contains authentication gateway components that handle
authentication mechanisms to access content behind paywalls and SSO systems.

Components:
- OpenURLResolver: Resolves DOIs through OpenURL resolvers
- OpenURLLinkFinder: Finds publisher links on resolver pages
- resolve_functions: Utility functions for URL resolution

These were moved from url/helpers/resolvers as they are authentication
mechanisms rather than URL discovery mechanisms.
